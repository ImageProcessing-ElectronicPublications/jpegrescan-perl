# JPEGrescan: losslessly shrink any JPEG file 

JPEGrescan is a perl script that uses jpeg tools to optimize jpeg compression by micro-managing some of the compression math based on research into some of the most common parameters.

As this script didn't have any homepage (coming from a pastebin), I wanted to host it on github. All thanks to **Loren Merritt** who created this script.
